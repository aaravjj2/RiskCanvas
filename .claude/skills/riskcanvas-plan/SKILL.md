# RiskCanvas Plan
When invoked, produce a deterministic implementation plan for this repo:
- Create/refresh TASKS.md with milestones + acceptance criteria.
- Keep scope MVP-first (stocks + Euro options + fixed-coupon bonds + stress tests + export).
- Every task must have a verification step (tests, snapshot hash, or reproducible artifact).
Output:
1) TASKS.md
2) A short next 3 tasks list to execute immediately.
